# Excel_Intreperter
A intreperter written in vba/excel
It works it has variables, loops etc. I havent put alot of time into it and if you want to check its syntax or how to use it for now. Go look at the vba code and figure it out. GoodLuck! 



if_statement_cell_val;
a2;=;10;[
print;b1;10;if_statement_cell_val;
a2;=;10;[print;c1;10;];];

this is valid code mabye it will help you figure out the rest of the syntax. The above Highlights that nesting is possible etc.
